LINQ extends the language by the addition of query expressions which are akin to SQL statements and can
be used to conveniently extract and process data from arrays enumerable classes XML documents relational
databases and third-party data sources Other uses which utilize query expressions as a general framework
for readably composing arbitrary computations include the construction of event handlers or monadic parsers

LINQ also defines a set of method names called standard query operators or standard sequence operators along with
translation rules used by the compiler to translate fluent-style query expressions into expressions using
these method names lambda expressions and anonymous types
